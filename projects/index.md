A list of the many projects that I've been part of over my lifetime.

Assorted Projects
---------------

Stuff I do as a hobby in my spare time.

* IBM Wheelwriter

BASLQC
------

Projects I've worked on as part of the [Bibliotheca Anonoma Software Liquidation Commission.](https://github.com/BASLQC)

### 2015

* [BASLQC VNDS Wiki](https://github.com/BASLQC/vnds/wiki) - Unfortunately, it looks like the VNDS Digital Haze forums have collapsed entirely, and the Wiki is in a percarious state (with the dropbox links lost). I am liquidating what I can.

Bibliotheca Anonoma
-------------------

Projects I've worked on as part of the [Bibliotheca Anonoma](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki).

### 2015

* [Moot's Final 4chan Q&A Transcript](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/Moot%27s-Final-4chan-Q%26A-Transcript) *(ongoing)* - A project to transcribe Moot's 8-hour ramblings, and extract the true poignant meaning of his words. Moot is the most important primary source for early 4chan history, and behind-the-scenes administration info.
